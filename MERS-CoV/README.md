### Source of data

Datasets used here were used in a pair of publications, [Dudas & Rambaut (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/2/1/vev023/1753363) and [Dudas _et al_. (2018)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/31257), and are ultimately derived from [publicly and privately shared](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31257.034) MERS-CoV sequences.
