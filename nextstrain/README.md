# Auspice / nextstrain JSON parsing

### Source of data

The datasets used here are derived from public nextstrain builds for [Nipah](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/all), [measles](https://nextstrain.org/measles/genome), [avian](https://nextstrain.org/avian-flu/h5n1/ha/2y) and [human H3N2](https://nextstrain.org/seasonal-flu/h3n2/ha/6m) influenza A viruses, managed and maintained by other researchers (see the 'meta' field of each JSON). A MERS-CoV maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree derived from [Dudas _et al_. (2018)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/31257) originally in nexus format is also used here to showcase baltic's ability to export to auspice JSON format.


### Visualisation(s)

Visualisations here reproduce visual elements used in nextstrain such as pie charts displayed on a map (e.g. Nipah and measles viruses), and tangled chains (e.g. avian influenza).
