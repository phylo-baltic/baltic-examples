Data generators should be cited where possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances. Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if uncertain.\n\n**We maintain four views of nipah evolution:**\n\n1. [`nipah/all`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/all), which focuses on the broader viral diversity of all nipah sequences submitted to GenBank that have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).\n2. [`nipah/human`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/human), which focuses on samples where host is annotated as \"Homo sapiens\" and that have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).\n3. [`nipah/I`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/I), which excludes samples annotated as from Malaysia, USA, Cambodia or is missing the country annotation all together. Samples must have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).\n4. [`nipah/II`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/II), which excludes samples annotated as from India, Bangladesh, or Thailand. Samples must have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).\n\n#### Underlying data\n\nWe curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as starting point for our analyses. Curated sequences and metadata are available as flat files at:\n\n*
