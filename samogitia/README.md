# Processing posterior sets of trees from MCMC

### Source of data

The datasets used here come from multiple sources. The host and country-annotated bat rabies virus trees (reduced to 100 trees) came from a [BEAST tutorial](https://beast.community/workshop_discrete_diffusion) analysed in a pair of papers by [Streicker _et al_. (2010)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1188836) and [Faria _et al_. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2012.0196). The Ebola virus trees (reduced to 100 trees) came from [Dudas _et al_. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22040).


### Visualisation(s)

Code here shows how to produce figures similar to Figure 4 of [Dudas & Bedford (2017)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12862-019-1567-0) (itself inspired by similar figures, e.g. Figure 3 of [Lemey _et al_. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003932)). Most of the code provided here is to showcase the use of samogitia for analyses of posterior trees.
