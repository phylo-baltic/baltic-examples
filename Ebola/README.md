# 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic

### Source of data

The MCC tree used here is derived from an analysis of EBOV genome sequence from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia sequenced during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic published in [Dudas _et al_. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22040).

This project was a collaboration between the many groups that sequenced virus genomes during the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa. Most of the sequence data has been deposited in GenBank but this repository represents a comprehensive data set curated and annotated by the groups involved.

Although most of the sequence data is publicly available on GenBank, this tree was released under a Creative Commons Attribution license.

### Visualisation(s)

The code here shows how to reproduce, in part, [Figure 1](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22040/figures/1) and [Figure 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22040/figures/2) of Dudas _et al._ (2017) as well as additional visualisations that didn't make into the paper but might be useful for others visualising large annotated phylogenies.
